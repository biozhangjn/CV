My pagedown rendered CV

This repo contains the source-code and results of my CV built with the pagedown package.

The main files are:

index.Rmd: Source template for the cv, contains a variable PDF_EXPORT in the header that changes styles for pdf vs html.

index.html: The final output of the template when the header variable PDF_EXPORT is set to FALSE. View it at github.com/biozhangjn/CV.

Jiannan Zhangâ€™s CV.pdf: The final exported pdf.

positions.csv: A csv with columns encoding the various fields needed for a position entry in the CV. A column section is also available so different sections know which rows to use.

The source code was derived from https://github.com/nstrayer/cv/, with modifications:

```
.pagedjs_page:not(:first-of-type) {
  --sidebar-width: 0rem;
  --sidebar-background-color: #ffffff;
  --main-width: calc(var(--content-width) - var(--sidebar-width));
  --decorator-horizontal-margin: 0.2in;
}
```

This trunk is to make only the first page has a side-bar and the rest of the page fill in the whole page. see https://community.rstudio.com/t/pagedown-html-resume-with-aside-on-first-page-only/46351
